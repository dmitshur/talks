Talk Format
-----------

-	Full 18 minutes for talk, 2~ mins questions.
-	Be more technical, maybe show how goroutines work in JS.
-	Don't be too sales-y, make it interesting even for someone who won't ever use GopherJS. Talk about challenges, etc.

Ideas
-----

-	Challenges slide. List pros, cons, solutions. (From guru talk.)
-	Project Status, what's next, future. (From AtmanOS talk.)
-	Consider a "How can I help?" slide for GopherJS. Suggested by Haneen, etc.
-	Establish wasm as a likely/certain future. https://github.com/go-interpreter/proposal/issues/1#issuecomment-242697060 mentions wasm.
-	Coming from JavaScript and its batman, show some of my favorite Go snippets in the browser, implementations/use of io.Reader/Writer, blocking code, using Fetch API, API.
