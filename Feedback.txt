First practice run with Matt
----------------------------

-	[x] Get rid of known obvious large sections of code like io.Reader/io.Writer docs.
-	[x] Explain _motivation_.
-	[x] No ad-hoc code. Too much code, unorganized, messy, hard to follow, etc. Need to distill it more.
-	[x] Maybe need to show/explain dom package before using it.
