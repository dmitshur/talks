Over the past 1.5 years, I’ve been experimenting with pushing the limits of Go by trying it in unusual environments. [The result is font-rs, a font renderer written in Rust, almost an order of magnitude faster than the industry-standard FreeType. At this point, it’s more of a technology demo than a production-quality library, but it’s certainly far enough along to analyze its speed. In this post, I’ll talk about exactly how it achieves such remarkable performance.]
