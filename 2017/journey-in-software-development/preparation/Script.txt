		- startups with lots of money are bottlenecked on people
		- as a programmer, you're in demand, and you can say yes/no to things to shape the world - the world you end up living in is partially in your control, as long as you're willing to make sacrifices to achieve that. depends on your priorities.

- Story of Feross http://feross.org/about/
	- In September 2010, I built YouTube Instant (a really fast way to search YouTube) in just 3 hours as a bet with my roommate. The site garnered immediate worldwide media attention â€” 1 million visitors in 10 days, and hundreds of news stories. Chad Hurley, CEO and co-founder of YouTube, was so impressed that he immediately offered me a job at YouTube (which I had to turn down in order to finish my degree).
