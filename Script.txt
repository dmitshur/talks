# This is Go in the browser. I'm Dmitri. [I'm a software engineer at Sourcegraph.]

My goal for this talk is tell you about some interesting uses of Go in the browser, give you an idea of what it can be like.

We'll start off with some motivation, then GopherJS history to give you an idea of the state of Go in the browser, and get into some interesting samples.

There will be quite a bit of code, and we'll go through it quickly. The slides will be up after this.
